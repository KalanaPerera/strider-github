What we want from a provider

# For "Hosting Providers"
Like github, bitbucket, etc.

## Account-wide oauth hookage

## Listing available repositories

## Project "setup"

- install ssh keys
- setup webhooks

# For everything

## "clone" command

This is where it gets used in the build process. Right after the "env"
phase, and as the first step of the "prepare" phase.

## project config

This is different from plugin config in that it is not under version
control. You'd have a bit of chicken-and-egg going on there.

## project setup

?? does this have to be different from the configure page? Maybe
not. Nope, I don't think so.
